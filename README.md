# test6thform




This is  simple program that is run in the console 
ensure .NET 6.0 is available 
written in c# (VERSION 10)

Test cases for this program:

*empty value* = error message: Empty Name, Rerun Program!
Helen-moss = Helen-Moss
mArk mcarthur o'bRien = Mark McArthur O'Brien




THE MAIN PROGRAM FILE IS Program.cs

With the latest .NET versions and c# , most of the functions are implicit ,
making it easier to code and straightforward. which is why in my sample ,
it goes straight to the console output rather than stating all the codes that are used to be written prior versions 
eg using System ; etc 


To run this:

Make sure you have dotnet installed on your pc/you can do this 
on your terminal by brew install for mac  
Assuming you have done this , you can use the vs code terminal to 
run this applciation :
first: dotnet new console to initiate this applciation 
you can then select the program.cs and open in terminal 
then dotnet run to start this application 

program exits after  user enters name and its sorted
you'll have to do 'dotnet run' again to restart this application
